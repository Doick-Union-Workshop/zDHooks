# zDExtensions

**zDExtensions** is a Union plugin that extends the Gothic games by providing:

- customisable ZenGin hooks, accessible through an API, which let you extend existing game systems via Daedalus scripts,
- new external functions, enabling Daedalus scripts to directly communicate with the ZenGin engine.

Together, these features make it easier to integrate new mechanics, modify gameplay, and expand the possibilities of Daedalus scripting.
